            Welcome to OCR Project, an innovative new optical character
            recognition technology developed by a team of dedicated students.
            Our goal is to create a user-friendly OCR tool that can accurately
            scan and extract data from a wide range of document types.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg py-2  ">
            We are a group of computer engineering students who are passionate
            about technology and its potential to make people's lives easier. We
            have been working on this project for several months, and we are
            excited to finally share it with the world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg py-2">
            Our OCR technology is designed to be easy to use, even for those
            with limited technical knowledge. It can handle a wide range of
            document types, including invoices, receipts, and business cards.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg py-2">
            We are still in the early stages of our project, but we are
            committed to constantly improving and updating our technology to
            stay ahead of the curve.
